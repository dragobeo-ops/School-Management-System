    <h1> Our Facilities</h1>
    <p>A school should have well-ventilated and spacious classrooms 🏫, a well-stocked library 📚, and fully equipped
      science laboratories 🔬 to support learning. It must provide a modern computer lab 💻 and a large playground
      🏃‍♂️⚽ for physical activities. Clean drinking water 🚰 and hygienic washrooms 🚻 are essential for students’
      health. A comfortable staff room 🪑, proper administration offices 🗂️, and a medical room 🏥 help the school run
      smoothly. Facilities like an auditorium 🎤, security systems 🔒, transport services 🚌, a clean canteen 🍽️, and
      smart classroom tools 🖥️ further create a safe, supportive, and effective learning environment for all students.

        <h3>World Class library</h3>
        <p>A school library is an essential place where students can explore a wide variety of books, gain new
          knowledge,
          and strengthen their reading skills. It provides a quiet and comfortable environment that helps students focus
          on studying, completing assignments, and doing research. With storybooks, reference materials, and digital
          resources, the library encourages curiosity and supports academic growth. It also helps students develop good
          reading habits and a love for learning, making it an important part of every school.</p>

        <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
        <p>Our basketball playground is one of the most lively and enjoyable areas of our school. It has a smooth,
          well-marked court with strong hoops, which makes playing more fun and safe. Students gather there to practice
          dribbling, passing, and shooting, while also improving their teamwork and confidence. During sports periods
          and
          after school, the playground becomes a place full of energy, where friendly matches and small competitions
          take
          place</p>
